            How does impact change over a scientific career?</br>
            Does impact, arguably the most relevant performance measure, follow predictable patterns?</br>
            Can we predict the timing of a scientist's outstanding achievement?</br>
            Driven by these questions, the team of this case studied the evolution of productivity and impact throughout thousands of scientific careers. They reconstructed the publication record of scientists from seven disciplines, connecting each paper with its long-term impact on the scientific community as quantified by citation metrics. We found that the highest-impact work in a scientistâ€™s career is randomly distributed within her body of work. That is, the highest-impact work has the same probability of falling anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist. It could be the first publication, appear mid-career, or emerge last. This result is known as the random impact rule.</br>
            In this visualization, they show the random impact rule in all its power. We can explore careers in different disciplines, rank scientists according to different career parameters, or select a subset of them. We will always find the impact peaks occurring all over the place, from the beginning of a career on the left to the end of a career on the right.

                Line: Publication record of a scientist.</br>
                Dots on the line: Publications of the scientist</br>
                Height of bumps in the line: Number of citations after ten years for the corresponding paper.</br>
                Blue bump: Highest impact paper of a scientist.</br>
                Height of line: Number of citations after ten years.</br>
                From left to right, this case arranges the first to the last paper of a scientist, ignoring their timing of publication. </br>
                The position of the highest impact paper of a scientist can be with the same probability, anywhere in her sequence of papers - it could be the first publication, could appear mid- career or could be a scientist's last publication. In other words, impact is randomly distributed within a scientist's body of work, regardless of publication time, order in the sequence of publications, discipline or groups of scientists selected. This result is named "random impact rule". Check the paper for more details!

            1. This case adopts multiple dimensions to conduct classified statistical analysis of big data</br>
            2. This case provides interactive capabilities to annotate data, partition selection, and so on.</br>
            3. Where the curve protrudes, it is highlighted by color gradient and light effect, which naturally reduces the difficulty of data visualization analysis</br>
            4. The line of data shows no ghosting, which has little influence on the error of data perception</br>
            5. It's a nice color scheme</br>
            6. The choice of subject is very thoughtful
